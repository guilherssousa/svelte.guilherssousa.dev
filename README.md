# My personal den

This project is a collection of my personal thoughts and ideas. It is a place where I can write down my thoughts and ideas and share them with the world without worrying about following guidelines or dealing with the hassle of publishing a fully fledged article.

Here, I can just write down anything that comes to my mind and that is fully suficient for me.

## Tech decisions

Although this project is not meant to be a fully fledged application, I still want to take some points on the tech decisions I made. This is my very first SvelteKit project and I am very excited about it. I am also using TailwindCSS for styling and experimenting Hygraph (ex GraphCMS) for the first time.

## Some things you can do

- Read my thoughts and ideas
- Check my about page
- See some of my favorite quotes
- Take a look at some cool pictures
- Change themes! (Inspired by [mxb.dev](https://mxb.dev))

## Things I might implement

- Summaries for each post (parsing Markdown)
- Spotify listening status (API integration already built)
- IMDb watchlist and tokens (like my own Letterboxd)
